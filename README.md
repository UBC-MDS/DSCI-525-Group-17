We will be using the [Daily rainfall over NSW Australia dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). We will use this data to train an ensemble model to predict rainfall and compare it to actual rainfall.  We will eventually have our machine learning model deployed to the cloud for others to use using the Amazon Web Service.
