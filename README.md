## Project Overview 
In this project, our team will train an ensemble model to predict rainfall and compare it to actual rainfall. We will eventually have our machine learning model deployed to the cloud for others to use using Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Data 
We will be using the [Daily rainfall over NSW Australia dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681).
